# Implementation-of-energy-efficient-routing-protocols-for-infrastructure-less-Opportunistic-networks
This repo is for my Computer Science Honours project where i am including energy-efficiency in opportunistic network (OppNets) routing protocols. The protocols I am modifying are: FirstContactRouter, WaveRouter, LifeRouter and  FloatingContentRouter.
